// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain







//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each 
    variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

let analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers seek to understand what will be required to build their plan, such as what stack, softwares, employees, etc. will be needed."

let design = "This is the third step, in which developers seek to pinpoint the details of how users will interface with the app. It adds more detail to the blueprint already established."

let testingAndIntegration = "This is the fourth step, in which developers build tests to make sure the software will work as intended."

let implementation = "This is the fifth step, in which the developers actually put the app in the hands of customers/users and ideally, open communication with them to solicit and receive feedback."

let maintain = "This is the final step, in which developers address any unforeseen bugs, make continual improvements based on feedback, and ensure updates are made."
